<h2>Hi,</h2>

<p>
👨‍🎓 Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management at Politechnika Poznańska, I'm on a journey to merge the worlds of technology and management.

🔬 My interests lie in Virtualization, MicroVMs, Linux internals, and Deep Learning. I'm captivated by the potential at the cutting edge of these fields.

🌱 Presently, my studies are focused on MicroVM architecture, Rust programming, and Stable Diffusion Algorithms - areas that promise to shape the future of tech.

🛠️ Outside of the classroom, I'm commited to research: creating a Change Detection Dataset Collection using state-of-the-art Generative AI methods. This practical work underscores my dedication to turning theory into tangible solutions.

✉️ Feel free to get in touch via email at simovar@proton.me. I'm always open to connecting, whether it's about collaborations, discussions on emerging tech, or exploring new opportunities in the tech sphere.
